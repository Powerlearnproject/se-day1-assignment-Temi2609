#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software efficiently.
The importance of software engineering in the tech industry are:
It ensures scalability, reliability, and security of software systems.
it promotes cost-effective and efficient development by following structured process.
it powers innovation and supports the tech industry's rapid growth.
it facilitates collaboration among development teams, leading to better products and solutions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. structured programmming: This introduced clear control structures (like conditional and loops) to improve code redability, maintainability replace chaotic and disorganized code.
2. Object-Oriented-Programminf(OOP): this focused on building software using reusable components, making code more organized, flexible, and easier to maintain.
3. Agile Methodology: this Transformed project management by focusing on quick cycles, user feedback, and flexibility, improving software quality and delivery speed.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The system development life cycle(SDLC) has six main phases 
1. Planning: this helps to define project goals, requirements, and feasibility.
2. Analysis: this helps to gather and document detailed user needs and system specifications.
3. Design: This helps to create the system architecture and design the beautiful user interface.
4. Development: This is  when you write the code and build the software.
5. Testing: Then you check for bugs and ensure the software works as intended.
6. Deployment & Maintenance: The final step is to  Release the software, monitor its performance, and make updates as needed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies:
1. They are linear and sequential: each phase is completed before the next begins.
2. They have fixed requirement i.e all the project requirement are defined at the start.
3. Less Flexibility: once the project is in progress Changes are difficult to implement .
4. Documentation-Heavy: Extensive documentation is needed at every stage of the project.

Waterfall Scenario: Medical Device Software
When developing software for a medical device that must comply with strict regulatory standards (like FDA approval), the Waterfall model is ideal. Requirements need to be fully defined upfront, and extensive documentation is necessary for legal and safety compliance. Any changes after development begins would involve a lengthy approval process.

Agile Methodology:
1. Iterative and Incremental: The  Work is divided into small, repeated cycles (sprints).
2. Flexible Requirements: The  Changes and improvements can be made throughout development.
3. Continuous Feedback: Regular collaboration with users and stakeholders ensures adaptability.
4. Light Documentation: It Emphasizes working software over detailed documentation.

Agile Scenario: E-commerce Website Launch
For an e-commerce platform launching a new feature, Agile is perfect. The team can release an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) quickly and iteratively improve the functionality based on customer feedback, adding new features like payment gateways or recommendations without disrupting the overall process.

Comparison between Waterfall and Agile :
1. Structure: Waterfall is rigid, while Agile is flexible.
2. Changes: Waterfall limits changes after the planning phase; Agile allows for ongoing adjustments.
3. User Involvement: Waterfall requires minimal client interaction after initial planning, while Agile involves constant collaboration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer:
Their Role: They writes code to build the software.
Responsibilities: They are to Develop features, fix bugs, and collaborate with other team members to ensure the software meets requirements.

2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
Their Role: They ensures the software works properly.
Responsibilities:THey test the software for bugs, verify features work as expected, and ensure the product meets quality standards before release.

3. Project Manager (PM):
Their Role: They Oversees the project.
Responsibilities:They plan timelines, manage resources, coordinate between teams, and ensure the project is completed on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE :IDEs streamline development by providing a unified interface for writing, debugging, and testing code. They offer features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and integrated debugging tools, which enhance productivity and reduce errors. Examples are visual studio code , sublime text editor.

VCS: VCS manage and track changes to source code over time, enabling collaboration among developers, maintaining code history, and facilitating code reviews. They help in resolving conflicts and rolling back changes if necessary. examples are Github, Gitlab

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. complexity: its difficult at times to be able to manage large and intricate codebase
Strategy: its to use modular design , break down the task and apply best practices for code organization
2. Deadlines: Meeting tight deadlines often leads to stress.
Strategy: Prioritize tasks, use project management tools to track progress, and manage time efficiently.
3. Changing Requirements: Adapting to evolving project requirements can be challenging at times.
Strategy: we can Implement Agile methodologies for iterative development and regular feedback.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: their focus is to test individual components or functions in isolation.
Importance: they ensures each part of the code works correctly on its own.

Integration Testing: their focus is to test how different components or systems work together.
Importance: they Verify that combined parts interact as expected.

System Testing:their focus is to test the entire system as a whole.
Importance: Confirms that the complete application meets requirements and functions properly.

Acceptance Testing: their focus is to test the system from the userâ€™s perspective.
Importance:  Ensures the software meets user needs and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to interact effectively with AI models. It involves crafting questions or instructions in a way that yields accurate, relevant, and useful responses from the AI.

Importance :
It Improves Accuracy: Well-crafted prompts guide the AI to generate better, more precise answers.
For Efficiency: Saves time by minimizing the need for multiple attempts to get the right response.
It maximizes AI Potential: Unlocks the full capabilities of AI models by asking the right questions or providing clear context.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me how to code"
Improved Prompt:
"How do I write a basic Python program that adds two numbers and prints the result?"

Explanation:
The reason why the improved prompt is more effective is that there is more specificity i.e focusing on a clear task(phyton program) instead of the broad idea of coding , more clarity i.e specify what the program should do (add two number and print the result) , more concise i.e clearly defines the task so as to make it easy for the AI to give a direct, actionable response about what is prompted .
